# Ancient Philosophy (1/2): Plato and his predecessors

Fabio Arciniegas notes from Coursera's University of Pennsylvania Course on presocratics by Susan Sauve Meyer available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/plato/

Philosophy as rational enquiry rather than colloquial interpretation
as set of precepts. Western tradition of use of Logos: reason. 

Four key BC ranges to keep in mind:
 - Presocratics(625-500)
 - Socrates(470-399)
 - Plato (430-347)
 - Aristotle (384-323)

# Presocratics

3 Milesians concerned with fundamental constituents:
 - Thales of miletus (625): Water 
 - Anaximander (610): Aiperon
 - Anaximenes (600): Air

Other presocratics, concerned with the idea of change:
 - Heraclitus (540) : everything in constant change
 - Parmenides (515) : change is impossible
 - Empedocles (490) : refutation of Parmenides

Link back to constituents and Atomists:
 - Anaxagoras (500)
 - Leucippus and Democritus (500)  

## The Milesians

 *Note*: References to the milesians writings are made according to
 Diels-Kranz. Fragments are marked "B" and Testimonia "A". Each
 philosopher has numbered entries. Whence Heraclitus B50 indicates
 50th fragment in DK. Furthermore, each philosopher has a number
 whence refs such as DK11A9 (Aristotle, testimonia 9) 

Aristotle calls the Milesians the first philosophers. They are
commonly concerned with identifying the internal innermost constituent
of the physical world.

  - Thales → Water
  - Anaximenes → Air
  - Anaximander → Apeiron.

In this sense they are said to be trying to understand the world "from the inside
out."  

## Heraclitus (535-475)

Known as _The Riddler_ or _The Obscure_, because of the unclear and poetic nature of its writings where he often uses "the unity of opposites."  He is also known as **The weeping philosopher**, as opposed to **Democritus** (the laughing one) because according to Theosphratus he didn't finish some of his works because of melancholia.  The pair is often mentioned in art including the Donato Bramante fresco and many satires particularly Lucian of Samosata "Sale of Creeds."

DK22B1: "People don't get it"

DK22B50: Listen not too me but to the logos.

His defining themes are (a) the union of opposites, made famous in many aphorisms, particularly "Changing, it rests" and (b) for Heraclitus change is constant ("you cannot step twice in the same river")

## Parmenides (515)

In straight opposition to Heraclitus, Parmenides considers change an illusion. The argument is fairly convoluted but has given an important starting point to important questions in epistemology. It goes as follows:

There are two ways of thinking one is correct and fruitful the other incorrect and leads to contradiction. The right way is thinking about "what it is," the incorrect is "what is not."

To think of what is not, according to Parmenides is a problem because it leads to contradiction such as in the following example:

1. there is no loch ness monster
2. I'm thinking of the loch ness monster
3. the loch ness monster is the subject so it IS.

The apparent contradiction begs the question of where exactly is there an error. Early epistemologists produce answers similar to "you are thinking of serpents and big things which do exist."

In any case, parmenides argues that to think "what is not" is invalid and to think of change is to ultimately think of something is not (something that _wasn't_ now is).

In parmenides view to think about changes is to  think about what "is not" and therefore to be in error.

## Empedocles (500)

Along with others Empedocles disagrees with Parmenides. He points out that the conflict is only there if you don't differentiate between the word "is" in predicative sense and "is" in the existential sense. Change involving the predicative sense bypasses the apparent paradox entirely. e.g. something wasn't of a particular color but now is. Simply changed color. We use "is" in the sentence "the dog is brown" in the predicative sense.

Empedocles is important also because of the key idea "all generation is alteration."

## Anaxagoras (500)

Anaxagoras continues the idea from Empedocles but with a different basic constituent, he calls it Nous.

In continuing Empedocles refutation of Parmenides, Anaxagoras provides a link back to the concerns of the Miletians and the question of constituents. Also basis for the first atomists.

## Leucippus and Democritus (~400)

Atomicists posing the existence of indivisible components of all matter and the formation of the natural world by swirling of the kosmoi.

One important part/motivation of their attempts was refuting Zeno's paradox (infinite cutting in half a finite distance).

# Plato

Studied here in the following pairing of books to main concerns:

 - The Meno: Epistemology: can virtue be thaught? what can be taught?
 - The Republic: What is justice? (what is the nature of forms)
 - The Timeaus: Origin of Natural world

## The Meno

Dialog named after the interlocutor, as usual. Starts by Meno asking about Virtue and whether it can be taught, that is "Arete," understood not as moral good necessarily but as excellence, greatness. Later it grows into the question of what can be taught and known.

The dialog, as usual in socratic dialogs is characterized by its format, named Elenchus (or Maieutic method) which is the socratic form of questioning rather than lecturing.  Socrates invites to "recall together" in a form of enquiry rather than "teaching."

When Socrates says that he doesn't know what Virtue is and asks Meno what Virtue he means, Meno can only give examples of virtuous things. This gives rise to the objection or worry that the Elenchus can only be negative and never produce solid positive knowledge. Socrates defends it with the famous geometry lesson:

Socrates brings a slave and starts asking him about a 1 square meter area and then asks him to construct one that is twice as large. The slave stumbles and guided by socrates finally arrives at the idea that taking the diagonal of the original square as the side for the second square is the right answer.

The geometry lesson is supposed to illustrate that the slave has an innate capacity to arrive themselves at the right conclusion if helped by the right questions. In this sense the slave is being helped to recall rather than taught the answer.

### Meno's paradox 

Meno's paradox is also known as the priority of definition. How can you start enquiring about virtue if you don't know what it is?

How can you start enquiring about anything if you cannot define it and how can you define it if you don't enquire about it?

Socrates answer is you only need true beliefs to enquire, not knowledge. Knowledge is stronger than true beliefs. You can believe the right thing for the wrong reasons.

Knowlege differs from true beliefs in the method by which it is
acquired, it is more stable. You can believe something false but you
cannot _know_ something false.

e.g. you may believe 317 is a prime number for the wrong reasons, say
because someone said all odd numbers are prime or because it was on a
list.

## The Republic

The main concerns in The Republic (~380 BC) are Justice and
Forms. Whether it is a virtue or not to be just, and how it applies to
both society and individual. The second concern, is theory of forms,
famous because of the allegory of the cave.

### Justice in Society

Thrasymachus starts by saying "justice is the advantage of the
stronger." Glaucon, his friend, also challenges Socrates.

Socrates starts by making  Thrasymachus  admit that a just man is
actually happy. The argument of the republic II-IV justice will always
be better even if unnoticed or unrewarded by gods or citizens.

The structure of the argument is roughly as follows: a city (Polis)
which exists for the skae of making it easier to provide for our
needs, has 3 jobs/parts: the Rulers, Auxiliaries (military), and
Producers (merchants).

 *Justice in a polis means everyone doing his jub and not meddling with others*

### Justice in the Soul

Just  like the polis has its roles for Ruler, Ally, Ruled, so does the
psyche (soul).  The tripartite soul (Freud studied it and echos it) is
made of Reason, Spirit, and Appetite.

In a well-functioning psyche the reason rules, the spirit is aligned
with the rulings of reason and not in opposition to them and the
appetites are measuredly fed and put to productive use.

The soul of the unjust is at civil war.

For example the money-grabbing man has enslaved the intellect to
appetite so his spirit cannot discern what the use of it is or what to
praise but it.

Justice is desirable on its own (not for reward) in the very special
sense that with a ruined soul life is not worth living and no amount
of power will make it so.

### Note: Principle of Charity vs Straw man

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy
based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument,
while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that
opponent.

The principle of charity requires interpreting a speaker's statements
to be rational and, in the case of any argument, considering its best,
strongest possible interpretation. 

Goodness is objective and reason's function is to clarify it.

### Plato' Theory of forms

One of the possible startitng points to explaing Plato's theory of
forms is the question of what is X. e.g. what is Courage, piety, or
justice. The main observation is that there is one thing that IS
courage and MANY things that are corageous. This difference between the
One and the many is essential to the plato's thoughts on this topic.

From the difference between asking about very tanglible, visible Xs
and asking about abstract Xs we introduce the allegory of the divided line.

### The allegory of the divided line

Socrates tells Glaucon about a line with a division between the
visible (e.g. a dog) and the intellifible (e.g. numbers). He then
suggests further dividing the lower half between the mere
images/reflections or shadows of tangible things and the tangible
things themselves. The result is the following:

``` 
First:

                       Visible                                     Intelligible
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

Further divided:

|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
      Shadows           Natural          Some ideas             Pure ideas
                                                  (geometry,nums)

``` 
The second, more famous allegory is that of the cave in which limited
experience deals with imitations or shadows of the real things.

The most important point is the notion of pure reason, unmediated by
metaphor, clearest in its truth, is the source and aspiration of all
knowledge. 

## The Timaeus

The Timaeaus is a dialog on the natural world, considered central in
classical tradition, even more so than the Republic. The idea of
Socrates being focused on the higher principles and sources (as
opposed to Aristotle) as portrayed by Raphael in his painting comes
from the Timeaus.

In the Timeaus Socrates talks about a likely story, an eikos logos,
where the Demiurge brings order in the primordial soup by copying from
the forms into the physical world.

From Model (Reason) the demiurge takes image and put it on a
receptacle. In doing so it takes reason and imposes order on
necessity. This is a translation of  pure goodness into constraints.

### The world's soul

The entire cosmos a kind of animal in the sense of possesing an anima,
soul, in which matehmatical order, regular and intelligent infuses
life and propends towards the highest good, the highest reason. In
this sense the world posesses a Mathematical soul.

The elements by which Socrates explains these are arithmetic means and
not explained in these notes. Also mentioned in the timeaus but not
explained here are perfect triangles and the derivation of the five
platonic solids: teta, hexa, octa, dodeca, icosa.
